# Webintosh

A MacOS like clone website made for giving a desktop-like experience while working with Web Applications and Websites.

Inspired from MacOS Big Sur, I have tried to make it as familiar as possible to Mac and I think this is tthe most familiar MacOS Clone made in html, css and js

I used purely HTML CSS and JS with no framework but some part of jQuery. I hope you like this!
